BreadCrumbs Tutorial

This is a brief tutorial to get you acquainted with the scripts provided in breadcrumbs. This is broke up by script and task. Examples are given using the Test.pcl file which is included in the BreadCrumbs package. Each of these commands should work from the command line in the breadcrumbs directory.

Enjoy and happy researching!


1. scriptPCoA.py
This script allows one to plot a PCoA of an abundance table. In the plot each sample is one marker. The marker shape and color is determined by a metadata (of your choice). The distances between each sample is determined by a specific beta-diversity distance metric. By default Bray-curtis distance is used. This can be changed as needed. You will notice for every call you must give it the sample id (-i) and the last metadata which should be the row before your first data (-l). This helps the scripts understand what is a data measurement and what is a metadata.

A. How do I make a PCoA of an abundance table, painting (coloring) it by a specific metadata?

python scriptPcoa.py -i TID -l STSite -p STSite Test.pcl

B. How do I make a series of PCoAs of an abundance table, one PCoA for every metadata?

If nothing is specified with -p then all metadata are painted. Note there are a max of 9 shapes to use, a metadata will be skipped if it has more than 9 levels (specific values which can be used many times). Don't worry, the script will let you know if this happens and will just skip to the next metadata.
python scriptPcoa.py -i TID -l STSite Test.pcl

C. How do I use a different beta-diversity distance metric instead of Bray-curtis distance?
Note the current two options are SPEARMAN and BRAY_CURTIS more can be added as needed.

python scriptPcoa.py -i TID -l STSite -m SPEARMAN Test.pcl

2. scriptManipulateFeature.py
Abundance tables can be difficult to manipulate. This script captures frequent tasks that may be important to manipualting an abudnance table including normalization, summin, filtering, stratifying the tables into subsets (for instance breaking up a large HMP table into tables, one for each body site), and other functionality. You will notice for every call you must give it the sample id (-i) and the last metadata which should be the row before your first data (-l). This helps the scripts understand what is a data measurement and what is a metadata.

* Remember you can do multiple tasks or use multiple arguments at the same time.
Here is an example of summing, normalizing, adding on clade prefixes, and stratifies the tables based on the STSite metadata

python scriptManipulateTable.py -i TID -l STSite -s -n -x -y STSite Test.pcl

I. Manipulating the measurements
A. How do I sum a table based on clade names?

python scriptManipulateTable.py -i TID -l STSite -s Test.pcl

B. How do I normalize a table?

python scriptManipulateTable.py -i TID -l STSite -n Test.pcl

II. Filtering
C. How do I filter a normalized table by percentage?

This filters out bugs that are not in the top 0.95 percentage of atleast 0.05 percent of the samples (a good default).
python scriptManipulateTable.py -i TID -l STSite -P 0.95,0.05 Test.pcl

D. How do I filter a count table by count occurence?

This removes samples that do not have atleast 5 counts in atleast 3 samples (an initial default to use could be 2,2).
python scriptManipulateTable.py -i TID -l STSite -O 5,3 Test.pcl

E. How do I filter a table by standard deviation?

python scriptManipulateTable.py -i TID -l STSite -D 1 Test.pcl

III. Filtering with knowledge of thier heirarchical relationship.
F. How do I make the table have only terminal nodes?

python scriptManipulateTable.py -i TID -l STSite -t Test.pcl

G. How do I remove all the OTUs from a table?

python scriptManipulateTable.py -i TID -l STSite -u Test.pcl

H. How do I reduce all bugs more specific than a certain clade? Aka, how do I reset a table to be only a clade (genus) or higher?

Ths reduces the bugs to bugs with 3 levels of heirarchy or less (class on a standard biological taxonomy).
python scriptManipulateTable.py -i TID -l STSite -c 3 Test.pcl

You may want to heirarchically sum all of you bugs before reducing the table to a certain level, just incase you are missing some.
python scriptManipulateTable.py -i TID -l STSite -s -c 3 Test.pcl

I. How do I reduce the table to a list of bugs?

python scriptManipulateTable.py -i TID -l STSite -b features.txt Test.pcl
python scriptManipulateTable.py -i TID -l STSite -b 'Bacteria|3417,Bacteria|unclassified|4904' Test.pcl

IV. Manipualte samples by metadata.
J. How do I stratify the table to subtables based on a metadata? (Example. How do I take the HMP table and break it up by body site or time point?)

python scriptManipulateTable.py -i TID -l STSite -y STSite Test.pcl

K. How do I remove all samples of a certain metadata value? (Example, How do I remove all gut HMP body site samples but leave the rest in the table?)

python scriptManipulateTable.py -i TID -l STSite -r STSite,R_Retroauricular_crease, L_Retroauricular_crease Test.pcl

V. Manipulate the bug names
L. How do I add on the k__ and s__ on the names of my bugs?

python scriptManipulateTable.py -i TID -l STSite -x Test.pcl


3. scriptPlotFeature.py
This script allows you to plot a row of an abundance table, metadata or data. This assums the first column is the id and the remaining columns are values to be plotted. Three different plots gave be generated based on the input arguments and the type of data given to the script. The script

A. How do I plot a box plot of two data.
A box plot requires two features, one not categorical and one that is categorical. The script detects this automatically and will plot the correct plot for you as you go.

python scriptPlotFeature.py Test.pcl STSite 'Bacteria|3417'

B. How do I plot a scatter plot of two data?
A box plot requires two features, both not categorical. The script detects this automatically and will plot the correct plot for you as you go.

python scriptPlotFeature.py Test.pcl 'Bacteria|unclassified|4904' 'Bacteria|3417'

C. How do I plot a histogram of a feature?
Just plot one feature.

python scriptPlotFeature.py Test.pcl 'Bacteria|3417'

D. How do I change the title or axes?

python scriptPlotFeature.py -t Title -x Xaxis -y Yaxis Test.pcl 'Bacteria|3417'

E. How do I change the color?
This script takes hex colors.

python scriptPlotFeature.py -c '#333333' 'Bacteria|3417'
F. How do i invert the colors for a black background?

python scriptPlotFeature.py -r 'Bacteria|3417'
